Using the UNION clause.

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

Ans. 	SELECT Cname,City,RATING
	FROM customers
	WHERE Rating>200 UNION
	SELECT Cname,City,RATING
	FROM customers
	WHERE Rating <=200;


2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
order.

Ans. 	SELECT Sname,Snum,Cname
	FROM salespeople
	JOIN customers using(Snum)
	WHERE Snum IN(SELECT Snum
 	FROM customers
     	GROUP BY Snum
     	HAVING count(Snum)>1)
	ORDER BY Sname,Cname;


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
besides the point.)

Ans. 	SELECT Snum
	FROM salespeople
	WHERE City='san jose' UNION
	SELECT DISTINCT Snum
	FROM orders
	WHERE Snum IN(SELECT Snum
	FROM orders
	WHERE Odate LIKE '03-OCT-%');
